This section defines the 'command' fdo serviceinfo module (fsim). An fsim is a set of key-value pairs; they define the
onboarding operations that can be performed on a given FDO device. Fsim key-value pairs are exchanged between the device and itâ€™s owning Device Management Service. It is up to the owning management service and the
device to interpret the key-value pairs in accordance with the fsim specification.

## fdo.command fsim definition
The command module provides the functionality to execute arbitrary commands on the device.
The following table describes key-value pairs for the command fsim.

The `fdo.command` module offers the ability to invoke a shell command on the FDO device during onboarding.  For this FSIM, only one command may be in progress at a time.  Commands may not be pipelined, with more than one command in a single ServiceInfo message.

(It is believed that buffering more than one command per ServiceInfo message will open the possibility for a buffer deadlock.  The authors accept that a more complex FSIM may permit multiple buffered commands to execute simultaneously or to be buffered, and welcome submissions.  

Commmands run to termination synchronously with the ServiceInfo processing.  I.e., no new ServiceInfo input is processed between the time that `command:execute` is processed and when that command finishes with `command:exitcode`.  The message command:sig applies to the currently executing command.

If a relative pathname is used, the command is assumed to run in a default working directory.  This directory MUST be consistent across calls to `fdo.command`, `fdo.download`, `fdo.upload` and SHOULD be consistent across other FSIM calls.  The working directory SHOULD be chosen to have the maximum available free filesystem space for storing and retrieving files.  The state of this directory is maintained across FSIM calls, but may NOT be maintained across invocations of the TO2 protocol.  For example, it is legal for the working directory to be a temporary directory that is automatically cleared across invocations of FDO.  A FDO Device without a file system may simulate a working directory in RAM.

It is intended that this FSIM support multiple OS targets, including Linux and MS-Windows.  Small devices might implement shell-like functionality for specific commands, to limit the need for custom FSIM's.  

The messages: command, args, may_fail, return_stdout, return_stderr may appear in any order, so long as they appear before the execute commmand.

| Direction | fdo.command.*                  | Value                             | Meaning                 |
|:----------|:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:------------------------|
| o --> d   | active | bool | Instructs the device to activate or deactivate the module  | 
| o --> d   | command| tstr | Specifies the command processor to execute (e.g. sh , bash, or cmd )  | 
| o --> d   | args | bstr | bstr encoded cbor array of arguments   | 
| o --> d   | may_fail | bool | If false, Device will terminate TO2 on error (FDO message 255); otherwise device will send exitcode and continue to process ServiceInfo.  This permits the Owner side to either take recovery action or fail the connection (FDO message 255).  | 
| o --> d   | return_stdout | bool | If true the device should return the standard out stream to the owner  | 
| o --> d   | return_stderr | bool | If true, the device should return the standard err stream to the owner  | 
| o --> d   | execute | cbor Null | execute the command  | 
| o --> d   | sig | int | Sends a signal to the running process.  Terminates all running commands.  | 

| Direction | fdo.command.*                  | Value                             | Meaning                 |
|:----------|:-------------------------------|:----------------------------------|:------------------------|
| d --> o   | stdout | bstr | A block of data containing standard out | 
| d --> o   | stderr | bstr | A block of data containing standard error | 
| d --> o   | exitcode | int | A block of data containing standard error.  Follows *nix convention, where exitcode==0 is a normal return. | 

The `may_fail` message indicates whether a failure of the requested command causes the TO2 protocol to fail.  For simple devices and simple onboarding situations, this may be sufficient to catch temporary failures, since FDO mandates that the Device will try to onboard again when TO2 fails.  If better logging of errors is needed, or if a failure of one `command` invocation is recoverable, a value of False for `may_fail` will permit any diagnostic messages to be transmitted as `command:stderr` messages and cause the (failing) exit code to be reflected in the `command:exitcode` message.  If the command is non-recoverable, the TO2 connection may then be dropped by the FDO Owner.  

The following table gives an example message flow for the fdo.command FSIM (long entries are reference to below the table).  In this example, the Linux **sfdisk** command is used to determine the storage space of a given disk storage device (/dev/sda).

| Device sends (json-style)      | Owner sends                     | Meaning   |
|:------------------------------ |:---------------------------------- |:------------------------ |
| - | `['fdo.command:active', True]` | Module is active |
| - | `['fdo.command:command', 'sh']` | Indicates shell to use |
| - | `['fdo.command:return_stdout, True]` | send stdout in reverse message |
| - | `['fdo.command:return_stderr, False]` | do not send stderr (swallow it) |
| - | `['fdo.command:may_fail', True]` | failure of command does not cause TO2 to fail |
| - | `['fdo.command:args', bstr .cbor *1]` | request (short) list of file systems.  Invokes command. |
| - | `['fdo.commmand:execute, bstr .cbor Null]` | Invoke command |
| [`'fdo.command:stdout', *2]` | - | stdout from invoked command 1 |
| [`'fdo.command:stdout', *3]` | - | more stdout from invoked command 1 |
| [`'fdo.command:exitcode', 0]` | - | exit code indicates command 1 is complete |

* ***1** is: `['sfdisk', '-al', '/dev/sda']`

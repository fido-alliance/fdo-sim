This specification defines the 'CSR' (certificate signing request) FDO serviceinfo module (FSIM) for the purpose of certificate enrollment. An FSIM is a set of key-value pairs; they define the onboarding operations that can be performed on a given FDO device. FSIM key-value pairs are exchanged between the device and it's owning Device Management Service. It is up to the owning Device Management Service and the device to interpret the key-value pairs in accordance with the FSIM specification.

## fdo.csr FSIM Definition

The CSR module provides the functionality to issue a certificate signing request from the FDO Device to a Certification Authority (CA) or a Registration Authority (RA) via the owning Device Management Service. It supports a subset of the functionality defined in RFC 7030, for example the full Certificate Management over CMS (CMC) functionality is not supported. The benefit of re-using RFC 7030 is the ability to integrate with existing certificate enrollment infrastructure. Such integration may, for example, utilize the owning Device Management Service to relay communication between a CA back and the device. The communication from the owning Device Management Service to the CA may happen via the Enrollment over Secure Transport protocol (EST). Since this specification re-uses the standardized payloads, those can be re-used for the communication between the owning Device Management Service and the device.

The CSR FSIM supports the following functionality:
- Distribution of CA certificates
- Enrollments of clients
- Re-enrollment of clients
- Server-side key generation
- CSR attributes

While the first three features are mandatory-to-implement in this FSIM, the latter two (server-side key generation and CSR attributes) are optional.

FSIM's communicate over a reliable channel that experiences communication security with confidentiality, integrity and replay protection. Certificate enrollment messages benefit from the security protection offered by the underlying channel but may require additional protection, depending on the use case. 

The following table describes key-value pairs for the CSR FSIM.

| Direction | Key Name                      | Value                      | Meaning   |
|:----------|:------------------------------|:---------------------------|:----------|
| o <-> d   | `fdo.csr.active` | `bool` | Instructs the device to activate or deactivate the module  | 
| o <-- d   | `fdo.csr.cacerts-req` | `uint` | Request to obtain CA certificates |
| o --> d   | `fdo.csr.cacerts-res` | `tstr` | CA certificates |
| o <-- d   | `fdo.csr.simpleenroll-req` | `tstr` | Certificate enrollment request |
| o --> d   | `fdo.csr.simpleenroll-res` | `tstr` | Enrollments of clients |
| o <-- d   | `fdo.csr.simplereenroll-req` | `tstr` | Request to re-enroll a client |
| o --> d   | `fdo.csr.simplereenroll-res` | `tstr` | Re-enrollment response |
| o <-- d   | `fdo.csr.serverkeygen-req` | `tstr` | Request for server-side key generation |
| o --> d   | `fdo.csr.serverkeygen-res` | `tstr` | Certificate and private key |
| o <-- d   | `fdo.csr.csrattrs-req` | `uint` | Request for CSR attributes |
| o --> d   | `fdo.csr.csrattrs-res` | `tstr`  | CSR attributes |
| o --> d   | `fdo.csr.error` | `uint`  | Error Indication |

## fdo.csr.cacerts-req and fdo.csr.cacerts-res

A device requests CA certificates by issuing the fdo.csr.cacerts-req message. The indicated value informs the owning Device Management Service in what format the CA certificates have to be returned. 

A successful response is conveyed in the fdo.csr.cacerts-res message. The format mandatory-to-implement is 'application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=certs-only' with value 281. The optional format is 'application/pkix-cert' with value 287.

The certificates returned by this request can be used to update trust anchors on the system, so that other CA-based operations (such as TLS connections) can use the updated trust anchors.  This includes, for example, the WGET FSIM.

## fdo.csr.simpleenroll-req and fdo.csr.simpleenroll-res

A device uses a Simple PKI Request, as specified in CMC (RFC 5272, Section 3.1 (i.e., a PKCS #10 Certification Request [RFC2986]). The payload in the fdo.csr.simpleenroll-req message is encoded as a 'application/pkcs10' payload. 
The Certification Signing Request (CSR) signature provides proof-of-possession of the client-possessed private key.

A successful response is carried in a fdo.csr.simpleenroll-res message, which carries the certificate encoded as 'application/pkix-cert'.

## fdo.csr.simplereenroll-req and fdo.csr.simplereenroll-res

A device uses a Simple PKI Request, as specified in CMC (RFC 5272, Section 3.1) i.e., a PKCS #10 Certification Request [RFC2986], to request a certificate. The payload in the fdo.csr.simplereenroll-req message is encoded as a 'application/pkcs10' payload. The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) signature provides proof-of-possession of the client-possessed private key.

A successful response is carried in a fdo.csr.simplereenroll-res message, which carries the certificate encoded as 'application/pkix-cert'.

## fdo.csr.serverkeygen-req and fdo.csr.serverkeygen-res

A device requests server-side key generation by issuing a fdo.csr.serverkeygen-req to the owning Device Management Service. 

The request uses the same format as the fdo.csr.simpleenroll-req and the fdo.csr.simplereenroll-req messages. The owning Device
Management Service and the certificate enrollment servers SHOULD treat the CSR as it would any enroll or re-enroll CSR, as 
described in RFC 7030. The only distinction is that the public key values and signature in the CSR MUST be ignored. These are
included in the request only to allow re-use of existing libraries for generating and parsing such requests.

If the device wants to receive an private key encrypted end-to-end from the device to the CA/RA there are two technical options, namely
* to use object layer security, and 
* to use communication security from the device to the owning Device Management Service and between the owning Device Management Service and the CA/RA. 

This specification utilizes the latter. A future version of this specification, or another FSIM, may introduce the object layer security solution.

A successful response is returned in the fdo.csr.serverkeygen-res in form of a multipart/mixed MIME payload with boundary
set to "fdo" containing two parts: one part is the private key and the other part is the certificate.  

The certificate is an "application/pkcs7-mime" and exactly matches the certificate response to simpleenroll response message.

The format in which the private key part is returned is dependent on whether the private key is being returned with
additional encryption on top of that provided by FDO.

Since this specification does not use the object encryption, the private key data MUST be placed in an "application/pkcs8". 
An "application/pkcs8" part consists of the base64-encoded DER-encoded PrivateKeyInfo with a Content-Transfer-Encoding of "base64" [RFC2045].

An example of a successful response to a fdo.csr.serverkeygen-req might look like:

```
--fdo
Content-Type: application/pkcs8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

MIIEvgIB...//Base64-encoded private key//..ATp4HiBmgQ
--fdo
Content-Type: application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=certs-only
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64

MIIDRQYJK..//Base64-encoded certificate//..dDoQAxAA==
--fdo--
```

## fdo.csr.csrattrs-req and fdo.csr.csrattrs-res

A device requests CSR attributes from the owning Device Management Service and consequently from the certificate enrollment servers with a fdo.csr.csrattrs-req message. The value carried in the fdo.csr.csrattrs-req message is ignored by the owning Device Management Service. 

A successful response informs the device about the fields to include in a CSR. This Certificate Signing Request (CSR) attribute messages is encoded in application/csrattrs format, as defined in Section 4.5.2 of RFC 7030.

## fdo.csr.error

The following table lists error codes returned by the fdo.csr.error message. 

| Error Number          | Description               | Sent in response to           |
|:----------------------|:--------------------------|:------------------------------|
| 1                     | Bad request.              | fdo.csr.simpleenroll-req      |
|                       |                           | fdo.csr.simplereenroll-req    |
|                       |                           | fdo.csr.serverkeygen-req      | 
|                       |                           | fdo.csr.csrattrs-req          | 
| 2                     | Unauthorized.             | fdo.csr.simpleenroll-req      |
|                       |                           | fdo.csr.simplereenroll-req    |
|                       |                           | fdo.csr.serverkeygen-req      | 
|                       |                           | fdo.csr.csrattrs-req          | 
| 3                     | Feature not supported.    | fdo.csr.csrattrs-req          |
|                       |                           | fdo.csr.serverkeygen-req      |
| 4                     | Rate exceeded. Try later. | fdo.csr.simpleenroll-req      |
|                       |                           | fdo.csr.simplereenroll-req    |
|                       |                           | fdo.csr.serverkeygen-req      | 
| 5                     | Unsupported format.       | fdo.csr.cacerts-req           |

An error of type 'unauthorized' is used when the request by the client cannot be processed by the Device Management Service, Certification Authority (CA) or Registration Authority (RA) due to insufficient permissions. The error of type 'bad request' is used when the request is malformed and parsing failed.

| `[fdo.csr.active, False]`  | - | Device instructs owner to deactivate the CSR FSIM |

## Payload Encoding Summary

This specification re-using standardized encodings for certificates, certificate signing requests, private keys and CSR attributes. This table summarizes them. For convenience, the format registered as a media type is used. 

| Media Type                                               | Reference           | Notes |
|:---------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------|:------|
| application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=certs-only            | [RFC5751]           | 1     | 
| application/csrattrs                                     | [RFC7030]           |       |
| application/pkcs10                                       | [RFC5967]           |       | 
| application/pkix-cert                                    | [RFC2585]           | 2     | 
| application/pkcs7-mime; smime-type=server-generated-key  | [RFC5751],[RFC7030] | 1     |
| multipart/mixed                                          | [RFC2046]           |       | 

Notes: 

1) application/pkcs7-mime media type is used to carry CMS content types, including EnvelopedData, SignedData, and CompressedData. To indicate what type of CMS data is contained, the smime-type parameter provides further help. "certs-only" refers to the CMS type SignedData and is used as a certificate management message to convey certificates and/or CRLs. The SignedData structure does not, in the degenerate case, contain signature information (see Section 2.4.2 of RFC 8551). "server-generated-key" is the parametervalue for Server-side Key Generation Response.

3) application/pkix-cert contains exactly one certificate encoded in DER format.

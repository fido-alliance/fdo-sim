This section defines the 'download' fdo serviceinfo module (fsim). An fsim is a set of key-value pairs; they define the 
onboarding operations that can be performed on a given FDO device. Fsim key-value pairs are exchanged between the device and itâ€™s owning Device Management Service. It is up to the owning management service and the
device to interpret the key-value pairs in accordance with the fsim specification.
